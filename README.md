# Simple-Linear-Regression-Data-Science-Project
Given the data set of weather (readings), Predict Apparent Temperature (C) given Humidity and other variables.
It's a very basic introduction to how to proceed towards completing a data science project.
Basic steps are 1. Reading data file using pandas 2. Very basic Exploration of data 3. Handling Missing values 4. Normalizing data 5. Splitting data into train and test sets 6. Applying a simple Machine Learning Algorithm 7. Making a Prediction. 
I also started from basic flow of work so I thought it might be helpful for someone who is just entering into this field. also feel free to poke and improve it.. :)
